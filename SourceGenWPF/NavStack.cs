        // The trick is to record the "from" and "to" position at each step.  When moving

        // the next "to" position.  This makes the movement asymmetric, but it means that

        // is to places we jumped away from.

        //   forward, one for moving backward.  Traversing the stack requires popping off one
        //   and pushing onto the other, rather than moving the cursor.  No change in
        //   behavior, but potentially easier to make sense of.

        //   forward to a Note we can highlight it appropriately.
        // TODO(someday): once we have the above, we can change the back button to a pop-up
        //   list of locations (like the way VS 2017 does it).
